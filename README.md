# GFlowNetsA
This repository contains the code for a 10 ECTS bachelor's level project about use GFlowNets for graph clustering.
The basic class of this repository is the GraphNet, found in the Graphclustering/Core/Core.py file, which has all the necessary methods to train the neural network
and sample graph clusterings from a given adjacency matrix. 
The graph clustering folder is setup with an __init__ file, such that the classes and functions in core can be used across the entire library.
