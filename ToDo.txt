ToDo:
    - Implement Gibbs sampler (Nikolaj)
    - Remove lastnodeplaced (Fabian)
    - Read Amortized clustering (Everyone)
        - Think about node-order invariant inputs
    - Conduct larger test (Gabriel)
        - Extract the entire distribution
    - Look at changes in the loss function. 
    - Look at the -np.inf exact posteior value.
    - New symmetric data inputs. Simple variant: count number of edges. 
    - Test Z0 (Total flow).
