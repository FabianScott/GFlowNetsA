ToDo:
    - (G:X) Read Amortized clustering (Everyone)
        - (X) Has been implemented.

    - ( ) Solve problem in Karate Calculations where new network is trained on samples starting from scratch (Fabian)

General ToDo:
    - Work on report
        - Consistent framing metaphors
    - Work on diagrams for report
    - Pitch
        - ( ) Manuscript (Gabriel)
    - Presentation

Diagrams/Figures ToDo:
    - Overall Karate results plot
    - 6 node exact, network and Gibbs plot (To show it works. Show what we want to generalize)

Sørgsmål til Mikkel:
    - Result heuristics? What is the best way to compare? Our suggestion: Compare IRM and empirical densities (network and Gibbs). 
        - Other clever heuristics?  
        - Risk of very rarely seeing a clustering twice?
            - Results are in and all sampled clusterings only occur once. 
    
    - Result ideas
        - Compare joint IRM values of sampled clusterings. Order them by magnitude and plot them on top of each other. (Maybe best 1000 clusterings)
            - We expect them both to peak fairly high, Gibbs a bit higher. Hopefully the GFlowNet maintains high joint IRM values for longer.
                - Can softmax it to make it nicer (but widens extreemes and doesn't reflect the sampling process)
        - Some point heuristics, such as average joint IRM value and the like.
        - Compare subgraphs. How often are these 4 nodes clustered together? How do the top 10 clusterings look?
            - Hard to compare to ground truth directly, since A_alpha = 1 incentivises more clusters.  

    - Nikolaj: certain sections of the report you want Mikkel to look through. (Method or a part of theory)
    - Show him illustrations

    - Where is the Karate club clustering in your paper from? Just a nice IRM clustering? (We have calculated maximum likelyhood A).

    - How big/deep should the network be?
    - New results.

    Mikkel Suggestions:
        - Define Matlab like onehot clustering matrix. C matrix is the product of that and itself. 
            - (This representation is used extensively in the IRM and Gibbs code)
    Gibbs + GFlow collab:
    - Start with Gibbs samples to seed GFlowNet
    - Use Gibbs during training, but starting with a clustering found by the GFlowNet
        - How to choose?
            - Calculate IRM (Which one to chose)
            - Random (leading to the expected value on average)
        - Use samples from both methods?
