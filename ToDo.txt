ToDo:
    - ( ) Implement Gibbs sampler (Nikolaj)
    - (G:X) Read Amortized clustering (Everyone)
        - ( ) Think about node-order invariant inputs
        - ( ) New symmetric data inputs. Simple variant: count number of edges.
    - ( ) Check why 1 cluster is consitently very probable. Test Z0 (Total flow).
    - ( ) Look at changes in the loss function.

    - ( ) Implement simple flow difference train function (Take a step back)
        - ( ) Then, when that works, try trajectory balance loss
    
    - ( ) Fix import sys path (Gabriel)

General ToDo:
    - Work on report
    - Work on diagrams for report
        - Basic GFlowNet diagram
            - GFlowNet Lego Example Diagram. 
        - Show the IRM generative process
        - Exemplary clustering matrix
        - Flow diagram of how the clustering is constructed
    - Pitch
    - Presentation

Sørgsmål til Mikkel:
    - The model trains towards the correct objective for small graphs. What should we do from here?
        - Change state representation?
        - Best ways to scale it? It takes forever to sample from karate klub. NAN values in weights after some time. 
            - All weights too small?
        - What should our main priority be according to Mikkel?
    - Why is 1 cluster consistently so probable? Doesn't seem right. 
    - Video pitch idea (manim animation).
    - Report structure.
    - Gibbs sampler
    - Hør hvad målet med projektet er, og læg en blød timeplan. 
    - Fix .yml file...
