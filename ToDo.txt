ToDo:
    - ( ) Implement Gibbs sampler (Nikolaj)
    - (G:X) Read Amortized clustering (Everyone)
        - ( ) Think about node-order invariant inputs
        - ( ) New symmetric data inputs. Simple variant: count number of edges.
    - ( ) Check why 1 cluster is consitently very probable. Test Z0 (Total flow).
    - ( ) Look at changes in the loss function.

    - ( ) Implement simple flow difference train function (Take a step back)
        - ( ) Then, when that works, try trajectory balance loss
    
    - ( ) Read Simple GFlowNet and Cube environment thoroughly and understand differences in sampling and train functions 
    - ( ) Read Bengio GFlowNet tutorial to see, how they solve some of these problems
        - ( ) That and the old code in the cube environment. 
    - ( ) Fix import sys path (Gabriel)

General ToDo:
    - Work on report
    - Work on diagrams for report
        - Basic GFlowNet diagram
            - GFlowNet Lego Example Diagram. 
        - Show the IRM generative process
        - Exemplary clustering matrix
        - Flow diagram of how the clustering is constructed
    - Pitch
    - Presentation
