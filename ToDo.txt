ToDo:
    - ( ) Implement Gibbs sampler (Nikolaj)
    - (G:X) Read Amortized clustering (Everyone)
        - ( ) Think about node-order invariant inputs
        - ( ) New symmetric data inputs. Simple variant: count number of edges.
    - ( ) Update to equation 25 (Gabriel). Test Z0 (Total flow).
    - ( ) Look at changes in the loss function.

    - ( ) Implement simple flow difference train function (Take a step back)
        - ( ) Then, when that works, try trajectory balance loss
    
    - ( ) Fix import sys path (Gabriel)
    - ( ) Solve problem in Karate Calculations where new network is trained on samples starting from scratch (Fabian)

General ToDo:
    - Work on report
    - Work on diagrams for report
        - Basic GFlowNet diagram
            - GFlowNet Lego Example Diagram. 
        - Show the IRM generative process
        - Exemplary clustering matrix
        - Flow diagram of how the clustering is constructed
    - Pitch
    - Presentation

Sørgsmål til Mikkel:
    - GFlowNets
        - Vertice values are trained and not edges. We then flow according to them.
            - This is incorrect right? Best way to proceed. 
        - Network currently choses node in action step. Set node order, like other papers?
            - Randomly permute node order? Risk of overfitting to node order?
    - Gibbs sampler
        - also takes a specific node order. Permute randomly?
        - Why burn in? How?
        - Ask about daig part of matrix product. Do you assume 0 diagonal in adjacency matrix?
        - Make efficient by reusing link counts. I can look at that in the future. 
    - Hvor lang synes du rapporten skal være?
    - Video pitch idea (manim animation).
    - Report structure.
    - Gibbs sampler. 
    - 

    - Define Matlab like onehot clustering matrix. C matrix is the product of that and itself. 
    - Generative IRM process, but shown using a graph.
